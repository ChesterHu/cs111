Abstractions:
  It's a technique for arranging complexity of computer system. It will establishing a level of complexity. Higher level will suppress the complexity of lower level. Thus programmers can handle a idealized interface and won't consider details that are too complex.

Overhead:
  It's the resources required to set up an operation. It might seem unrelated, but necessary.

It's like when you need to go somewhere, you might need a car. But, it would be a lot of overhead to get a car to drive down the street, so you might want to walk. However, the overhead would be worth it if you were going across the country.

In computer science, sometimes we use cars to go down the street because we don't have a better way, or it's not worth our time to "learn how to walk".
