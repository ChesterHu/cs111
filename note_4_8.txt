Abstractions:
  It's a technique for arranging complexity of computer system. It will establishing a level of complexity. Higher level will suppress the complexity of lower level. Thus programmers can handle a idealized interface and won't consider details that are too complex.


DESIGN GOALS:
------------
Overhead:
  It's the resources required to set up an operation. It might seem unrelated, but necessary.

It's like when you need to go somewhere, you might need a car. But, it would be a lot of overhead to get a car to drive down the street, so you might want to walk. However, the overhead would be worth it if you were going across the country.

In computer science, sometimes we use cars to go down the street because we don't have a better way, or it's not worth our time to "learn how to walk".

  -- Minimize the overheads of OS, that is maximize the performance. While consider the Visulization and making it easy-to-use.
  -- Provide protection between programs. Maliciously or accidentally, some programs will have bad behavior, don't let it affect other process while it's breaking. Thus we need isolation.
  -- Reliability, OS must run non-stop. If it fails, all other application running on the computer fail as well.
  -- Some other goals are also important: energy-efficiency, security, mobility.
