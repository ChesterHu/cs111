Program vs Process Address Space:
---------------------------------
  shared code   private data   shared_lib_1    shared_lib_2

  shared_lib_3
  
                                              private stack
Characteristics of Libraries
----------------------------
Chose which part of the code to be used in our program? How to allocate that code?  
  1. Static
  2. Shared
  3. Dynamic

Shared Libraries
----------------
  1. Reduce memory consumption: using libraries that are already been used. 
  2. Not all modules will work in a shared library, because libraries don't know the existance of our program

DLL Dynamic Load Library
------------------------
  Can be load inplace when program is compiled (run-time loader), save more memories, but get cost in the compilation process.
 
Fork use the same address space, exec store the address space and make a copy of it.
